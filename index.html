    <img src="/Users/matt/week_1_portfolio/assets/images/me.jpg">
    <p>Hey Y'all! The name is Matt. Im as Florida as it gets. Ive lived in verious parts of 
        Florida my whole life. I love my Jacksonville Jaguars and my Florida Gators. I've been 
        fishing fresh water lakes and ponds for as long as i can remember. 
        
        Nothing against salt water, thats just my prefered type of fishing. 
        I have traveled a bit and once joined the greatest military branch to walk this planet.
